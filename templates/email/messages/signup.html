    If you are a member of the ARC, your fair entry pass will be put
    into your church mailbox on Sunday, August 3rd. If you are NOT going to be at
    church that week, please make alternate arrangements with me to get your entry
    ticket. I will be in touch with all non-ARC members to make arrangements to
    get you your pass.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you,<br/>
